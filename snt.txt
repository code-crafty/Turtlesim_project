To build and run a diffrential bot on gazebo we need the following file
the workspaece organisation will be like
~/catkin_ws/src/urdf_bot/scripts
~/catkin_ws/src/urdf_bot/urdf
~/catkin_ws/src/urdf_bot/launch
~/catkin_ws/src/urdf_bot/world
~/catkin_ws/src/urdf_bot/config

the scripts file contain the py code for the bot control
the urdf contain the xacro file and gazebo file for complete urdf description 
the world file contain description for the gazebo world  with .world extension
the launch contain the launch file for roslaunch execution
the config file contain the configuration for different topic and joint state controllers and pid value for motion contant values with .yaml extension.

the gazebo file contain the gazebo tag for each link and it contain data for any sensor or and transmission values and 
the pid values if donot match with the bot config values like the mass ect the bot will not perform well in gazebo world the values are adjusted using the rqt gui and by combining the rviz and gazebo to read the different parameters.

the controller and link in each joint is read using the rqt-graph graphical tool
the pid controller is accessed in the python file using the geometry_msgs topic
